I invite you, to read what I am sharing here of my experiences in following a path of love, of Divine Love. It is a discovery of soul and acknowledgment of the subtle transformative action that the Divine Love brings. A discovery of the relationship to our Creator, a discovery of Love so deep that I never dared to dream of it. Daily prayers and communion with God are the cornerstone of this life upon our pathway of Love Divine. It is a gentle path which does not need formalism or buildings or temples or preachers. No, it is simple, it is rather a way of life, a way of awakened living, a life of internal and eternal growth in Love, the Divine Love, an opening to God’s Truths and an awareness of God’s Presence, a purification and transformation of soul.

Padgett, Dr. Samuels’s channelings are a deep and profound blessing in that they provide continuity and integration between the teachings of the Bible and the revelations received through Mr. Padgett.
![](/sonstiges/buecher-die-wir-moegen/old-testament-sermons-book-cover-small.jpg/) [Old Testament Sermons](/sonstiges/buecher-die-wir-moegen/old-testament-sermons.pdf/) | For those who already are familiar with the messages received by James E. Padgett, Dr. Samuels’s channelings are a deep and profound blessing in that they provide continuity and integration between the teachings of the Bible and the revelations received through Mr. Padgett. The messages received by Dr. Samuels are fundamentally different from the so-called Padgett-Messages. This is not surprising when you consider that Dr. Samuels already had an extensive basic knowledge at his disposal, while James Padgett had to start from scratch before he was even able to receive the messages from high Celestial spirits. Dr. Samuels, on the other hand, was already aware of these basic revelations before he dedicated himself to the task of becoming active in mediumship.
